# Code Refactor

In this project I used my coding skills to improve html and css code on an existing site to make it more accessible, which would make it easier for people with disabilities to access the site.
I also decluttered and organized the code to make it easier in the future for any other coders to read it.
I also included descriptive comments in the code to explain what I did, to improve the overall readibility and access to the code
